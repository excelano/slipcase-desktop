.SYNOPSIS
    Refuse a binary that imports a DLL Windows does not ship.

.DESCRIPTION
    Slipcase 0.1.1 failed Microsoft Store certification on 2026-08-29 under
    policy 10.2.4.1. The package installed on the tester's clean machine and
    then would not start: *The code execution cannot proceed because
    VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found.* That DLL ships in the Visual C++
    Redistributable, not in Windows.

    Nothing this project runs could have caught it. The tests pass, the
    conformance corpus passes, the certification kit passed, and the
    application starts - on a machine with Visual Studio installed, which is
    every machine any of the three platforms has ever built on. The defect is
    invisible from inside the toolchain that causes it, so the check has to be
    about the artefact rather than about whether it runs here.

    This is the Windows analogue of the `ldd` line CLAUDE.md uses to check what
    the Linux binary links, and it exists for the same reason: the rule means
    the outcome, so check the outcome.

    It parses the PE import table itself rather than shelling out to dumpbin,
    because dumpbin comes with Visual C++ and a check that needs the toolchain
    is a check that cannot run where the toolchain is absent. Cross-checked
    against `dumpbin /dependents` on 2026-08-29: same names, same order.

.PARAMETER Binary
    The executable to read. Defaults to the release build.
