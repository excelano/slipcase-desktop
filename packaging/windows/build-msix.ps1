# Assemble the MSIX package the Microsoft Store distributes: the release
# executable, the manifest with the identity and the version substituted into
# it, and the five images the manifest names.
#
# `packaging/macos/build-app.sh` is the model, and the rule it works to is the
# one that matters here: refuse loudly rather than produce something subtly
# wrong. A bundle quietly missing an architecture, or a package quietly built
# from a debug binary, says nothing at the moment it is made and everything
# days later. Every check below exists because the thing it checks cannot be
# seen by looking at the finished package.

#   ...\build-msix.ps1 -SelfSign -Certify   # and run the certification kit
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
#
# It does not submit, and it does not produce a signature that goes anywhere
# near a submission. The Store signs what it distributes, so `-SelfSign` exists
# only so that a package can be installed on this machine and looked at. The
# certificate it makes is a throwaway, and `README.md` beside this file records
# that the measurement one before it was too.
