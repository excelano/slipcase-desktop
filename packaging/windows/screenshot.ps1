# Photograph the application's own window at a size the Microsoft Store accepts.
#
# `RELEASE.md` listed screenshots under *by hand, because no script can*, and
# that was an assumption rather than a measurement. What a script cannot do is
# decide which container to open and whether the result is a good advertisement.
# What it can do is every mechanical part: size the window so the visible frame
# is exactly the size asked for, bring it to the front, capture it, and refuse if
# what came back is the wrong size.

# TWO THINGS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, BOTH OF THEM PIXELS
#
# `SetWindowPos` sizes the *window rect*, which on Windows 10 carries an
# invisible resize border outside the visible frame: asking for 1366x768 gave a
# frame of 1352x761, which is under the Store's minimum. The visible frame is
# `DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS`, and the difference measured here is 14 by 7.
#
# And that frame's top edge is one pixel above what is actually drawn, so a
# capture at exactly the frame rect picks up a sliver of whatever is behind. It
# arrived as a strip of console text across the top of the first two attempts.
# The capture is two rows taller than needed and the top two are cropped.
