# Photograph the application's own window at a size App Store Connect accepts.
#
# The counterpart of `packaging/windows/screenshot.ps1`, and written for the
# same reason: `RELEASE.md` filed screenshots under *by hand, because no script
# can*, which was an assumption. What a script cannot do is decide which
# container to open or whether the result is a good advertisement. What it can
# do is every mechanical part — size the window, front it, move the pointer out
# of the frame, capture, and refuse if what came back is the wrong size.
#
#   ./packaging/macos/screenshot.sh --app dist-devid/Slipcase.app \
#       --container dist/quarterly-report.pdf.slpc --out shots/01-window.png
#
# THREE THINGS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
#
# **It captures the window by its id, not by its rectangle.** `screencapture -R`
# photographs whatever is on screen in that region, so anything overlapping the
# window lands in the picture — which happened here on the first attempt and
# came back as a screenful of terminal. `-l` takes the window's own buffer and
# is indifferent to what is in front of it.
#
# **The pointer is moved off the window first.** Windows found this the
# expensive way: a shot came back 2292 pixels different from its predecessor and
# none of them were the change being photographed, because the pointer was
# resting on a field and egui drew it hovered and focus-ringed with the scroll
# bar showing. Neither is wrong, and both read as an interface caught mid-use.
#
# **It photographs a bundle, never the bare executable.** A bare Unix executable
# has no bundle identifier and no icon, so it is not the thing anybody installs.
# On Windows the equivalent is photographing the packaged application. The
# closest this platform can get is a *signed bundle built from the same commit*:
# the Store package cannot be launched at all off the Store, which
# `CHECKLIST.md` records, so no screenshot can ever be of the exact artefact
# that gets uploaded. Build the bundle from the commit being released and say so
# in `packaging/store-listing.md`.
#
# Needs Accessibility permission for whatever runs it, because sizing another
# application's window goes through System Events. System Settings → Privacy &
# Security → Accessibility.
