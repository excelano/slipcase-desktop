//! What the desktop says about light and dark, where the window toolkit will not.
//
// Author: David M. Anderson
// Built with AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic)
//
// **This module exists for Linux and does nothing anywhere else.** `winit`
// answers `system_theme()` on the other two platforms — the Windows arm calls
// `should_use_dark_mode()` and the macOS arm reads `NSApplication`'s
// `effectiveAppearance` — and on Linux it returns `None` unconditionally
// (`winit-0.30.13`, `src/platform_impl/linux/mod.rs:909`, a body that is the
// word and nothing else). `egui-winit` passes that `Option` through untouched
// and egui falls back to `Theme::Dark`, so before this module every Linux user
// saw the dark card and no desktop setting could reach them.
//
// Measured 2026-08-28 before it was written, because the comfortable
// explanations had to be ruled out first. With GNOME set to Light the card drew
// dark; with `color-scheme` forced to `prefer-light`, so the portal answered
// `uint32 2` rather than `0`, the card drew dark again *and the window's own
// titlebar turned light in the same screenshot*. One window, two halves,
// disagreeing — which is what rules out the desktop having failed to say what
// it wanted. `CHECKLIST.md` holds the run and the pixel samples.
//
// The titlebar's answer comes from `sctk-adwaita`, which spawns `dbus-send` and
// greps its output for `uint32 1` under a 100ms timeout. That is the second
// implementation this window would have had, and it is why this one asks the
// portal properly rather than shelling out beside it.

/// Which way a `color-scheme` answer points.
///
/// A named type rather than `egui::ThemePreference` so that the mapping below
/// can be tested without a window, and so that the one case that is a judgement
/// rather than a reading — zero — is visible at the point it is decided.

/// What the desktop portal's `color-scheme` means, including the value that is
/// a decision rather than a reading.
///
/// The XDG specification defines three: 0 no preference, 1 prefer dark, 2
/// prefer light. **Zero is treated as light, and that is the whole of what makes
/// this module work on GNOME.** GNOME's Settings offers Light and Dark and
/// spells them `default` and `prefer-dark`, so choosing Light sets
/// `color-scheme` to `default` and the portal answers 0 — never 2. Measured on
/// GNOME 48.7: `prefer-light` has to be set by hand through `gsettings` and no
/// part of the interface will do it.
///
/// So reading 0 as *leave it dark* would mean every GNOME user who chose Light
/// still got the dark card, which is the defect this module was written for
/// wearing a different hat. Reading it as light is also what GTK does with
/// `ADW_COLOR_SCHEME_DEFAULT`, so an application that follows this rule looks
/// like every other application on that desktop rather than like the one
/// exception.
///
/// The cost is a desktop that is genuinely dark while declaring no preference,
/// where this now draws light. That desktop's GTK applications are drawing
/// light too, so the answer is at least consistent with its neighbours.
