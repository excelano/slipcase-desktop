//! The document macOS was asked to open, which does not arrive as an argument.

//
//! Linux and Windows both hand a double-clicked container to this application
//! as `argv[1]`, which is what `main` reads. macOS does not: it launches the
//! application with no arguments at all and then sends the document as an Apple
//! Event. Nothing was listening for one, so `AppKit` refused the event and Finder
//! reported *Slipcase cannot open files in the "Slipcase container" format* —
//! an accusation against an application whose association was correct. This
//! module listens.
//!
//! **This is the one place in this application that writes `unsafe`**, and
//! `src/main.rs` carries the `allow` that permits it. `src/lib.rs` is still
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and nothing here is reachable from it.
//!
//! It handles the event rather than replacing the application delegate.
//! `NSApplication` has exactly one delegate, winit sets its own inside
//! `EventLoop::new` and depends on it for startup, and there is no point in the
//! sequence where this code holds control in between. `NSAppleEventManager` is
//! additive: registering here displaces nothing of winit's, and the delegate
//! problem that made this look impossible does not arise.
