# Checklist: the things only a hand can test

`CLAUDE.md` and both handoff briefs have referred to this file since before it
existed. It did not: `git log --diff-filter=A` finds no commit that ever added
it, and the seven defects the Linux walkthrough is said to have found are
recorded in commit messages rather than here. Windows wrote the first section,
macOS the second, and Linux still owes the one whose defects the paragraph above
is about.

A section per platform. Each item says what to do, what should happen, and —
where a run found something — what actually happened.

---

## Windows

Run against a release build, because the console-window item below is a
property of the release profile and passes vacuously in debug.

    cargo build --release
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\windows\install.ps1

### The association

1. **Explorer draws the icon.** Put a `.slpc` in a folder and look at it in
   Large Icons and in Details. Both should show the card-in-a-case, not the
   blank page Windows gives an unknown extension.
2. **The type reads as a name.** The Type column should say `Slipcase
   Container`, not `SLPC File`.
3. **Double-clicking opens the container, not an empty window.** This is the
   argument path, and until Windows ran it, it had only ever been exercised on
   Linux. The window should show the container's name, its path, `conformant`,
   the payload card, and the metadata tree — not the empty state.
4. **The card names an application for the payload.** A container whose payload
   is `report.pdf` should say what would open it. Silence is a legitimate
   answer for a payload nothing is registered for, so use a name the machine
   has an association for.
5. **The Start menu entry works** and carries the icon.
6. **Uninstalling leaves nothing.** Before uninstalling, open a `.slpc` with
   "always open with" so a `UserChoice` exists — that is the key that outranks
   everything else and the one an uninstaller forgets. Afterwards, no key under
   `HKCU\Software\Classes` for the type or the extension, no `FileExts\.slpc`,
   no Add/Remove Programs entry, no shortcut. Explorer should go back to
   calling it `SLPC File`.

### What the first run found

Two defects, both invisible to 61 tests and both fixed in the same commit.

**A console window opened behind the application.** The executable was built
console-subsystem, so a file manager launching it — which is not attached to a
terminal — got a black console window with the executable's path as its title,
sitting behind the window a person actually wanted. Fixed with
`windows_subsystem = "windows"`, off in debug builds so a panic still has
somewhere to go.

**The window had no icon.** The title bar and the task bar showed the generic
default. `APP_ID` is what answers this on Linux and it does nothing here —
`with_app_id` is Wayland's, and neither egui, eframe, nor winit turns it into
anything on Windows. Fixed by embedding the `.ico` and handing its 64-pixel
entry to the window at startup, because compiling a resource the normal way
needs a tool `DESIGN.md` §2 keeps out of the build.

A third was in the packaging rather than the application: `install.ps1` closed
by telling the reader to check with `assoc` and `ftype`, and both report no
association at all after a successful per-user install. They read the
machine-wide half of the class root only.

### Not yet done by hand

- **A high-density display.** Every size above was checked at 100%. The icon
  carries 20, 40, and 64 for the scaled sizes and none of them has been looked
  at on a display that would ask for one.
- **A second user account**, to confirm a per-user install is invisible to one.
- **An upgrade over an existing install**, rather than a first install.

---

## Linux

Not written. The walkthrough happened — seven defects in layout geometry, font
coverage, frame timing, and controls that were drawn but did nothing — and the
record of it is in `git log` rather than in a file. Reconstructing it from
there is a job for whoever next has the platform in front of them.

---

## macOS

Run against a bundle, because almost nothing below is true of a bare
executable: it has no bundle identifier, Launch Services files it as a nameless
foreground process, and nothing can be associated with it.

    cargo build --release
    ./packaging/macos/build-app.sh
    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -f dist/Slipcase.app

### The association

1. **Finder draws the icon.** Put a `.slpc` in a folder and look at it as an
   icon and in list view. Both should show the card-in-a-case rather than the
   blank page macOS gives an unknown extension.
2. **Get Info names the type.** The Kind should read `Slipcase container`,
   which is the bundle's own `UTTypeDescription`, not `Document` and not
   `slpc File`.
3. **Double-clicking opens the container, cold.** With Slipcase *not* running,
   double-click a `.slpc`. The window should come up showing that container —
   its name, `conformant`, the payload card, the tree — and **no dialog**. The
   failure this guards against is specific and was the state of things for a
   while: *The document could not be opened. Slipcase cannot open files in the
   "Slipcase container" format.*
4. **Double-clicking opens the container, warm.** With Slipcase already running
   and a different container open, double-click another. It should replace what
   is on screen. This is a different code path from the cold launch and one of
   the three registration moments passes it while failing the cold one, so
   testing only this would have hidden the defect.
5. **The Open dialog starts where Finder was.** After opening a container by
   double-clicking, press Open a slipcase. The dialog should start in that
   container's folder.
6. **The card names an application for the payload.** A container carrying
   `report.pdf` should say Preview. Silence is legitimate for a payload nothing
   is registered for, so use a name the machine has an association for.
7. **A container opens Slipcase from the card.** With a `.slpc` as the payload
   of another container, the card should say `Slipcase`, which is this bundle
   naming itself through the same code that names Preview.

### What the first run found

The first thing a hand found here was not in the application at all. The
walkthrough could not be run by machine: `screencapture` returns the desktop
and the menu bar with every window omitted unless the terminal has been given
Screen Recording permission, and it reports no error when it does that. Two
captures of a screen with windows on it came back byte-identical and empty,
which is the only tell.

The double-click was the defect, and it took a person pressing it to find. The
tests, the corpus, and every command-line check passed while it was broken:
`open some.slpc` returns zero and the process starts, and the refusal is a
dialog that a terminal cannot see. It was recorded here as opening an empty
window before a person looked and read out the actual message.

A test fixture was wrong in a way that looked like an application defect. The
first container carried a hand-written stub `report.pdf` with no xref table,
and Preview refused it. Preview was right. Payloads for this walkthrough are
made with `cupsfilter` now, and the round trip is checked byte for byte before
the container is used.

### Not yet done by hand

- **A high-density display.** Every size above was checked on a 2560x1440
  display at 100%. The `.icns` carries entries to 1024 and none of the `@2x`
  ones has been looked at on a display that would ask for one.
- **A signed bundle.** Everything above is an unsigned bundle that never left
  the machine that built it. `mdls` reporting the wrong type is suspected to be
  a consequence of that and is untested either way.
- **A downloaded bundle**, carrying `com.apple.quarantine`, to see what
  Gatekeeper actually shows a person rather than what `spctl` reports.
- **A second user account**, and an upgrade over an existing install.
